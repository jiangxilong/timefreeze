TimeFreeze - Linux kernel module (tested on Fedora 13, kernel 2.6.34.9-69.fc13.i686)

This module locks ("freezes") linux kernel time to 1367935298L within
directory "~/workspace".
Technically, it redefines basic kernel functions (syscalls)
concerning time in the "sys_call_table".
Redefined syscall operates as follows: first the path is checked,
from where the syscall was called, then, if needed, some additional
instructions are performed, and finally the function falls back to
the original syscall.
Redefined functions are:

stat
lstat
fstat
newstat
newlstat
newfstat
stat64
lstat64
fstat64
("struct statbuf" fields are filled with 1367935298L)

time
gettimeofday
clock_gettime
(just return 1367935298L)

utime
utimes
utimensat
futimesat
(set the destination files times to 1367935298L)

The path "~/workspace" is defined in timefreeze.h
header. Time value to be locked at may be changed in timefreeze.c
(search "TF_current_time = 1367935298L").

Install:
To make this module simply use "make" tool (GNU Make). Be sure to have
kernel headers for your current kernel version!

Note:
create-sct-header.sh is a script to find "sys_call_table" address for
your system individually. Address is being taken from "System.map".
If you prefer to hide your "System.map" files or just do not have them,
please, create file "sct_address.h" manually, then type a single line
there, which may look like this:
#define SYS_CALL_TABLE_HARD_ADDRESS 0xc0798320
